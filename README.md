 /* this library contains the function rand() function which is used for generating a random number
 which is used in this program for casino game to generate no and in rps game for ai's response*/
#include <ctime> 


/* Include <ctime> for seeding rand() time(): This function returns the current calendar time as a 
time_t object, which represents the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970). It's 
often used to obtain timestamps or measure time intervals.*/


srand(time(0)); /* Seed the random number generator with current time Combining the time(0) function call with srand()
we are effectively seedingthe random number generator with a value based on the current time. Since the time is continually
changing, this ensures that the random number generator startswith a different seed value each time the program is run.
 As a result, the sequence of random numbers generated by rand() will be different for each run of the program.*/
