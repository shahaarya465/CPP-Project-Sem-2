# C++ Mini Project: Casino & Rock‑Paper‑Scissors Games

## Overview

This C++ console project offers two interactive games:

1. **Casino Game** – Guess a number between 1–10; win 10× your bet if correct.
2. **Rock‑Paper‑Scissors** – Classic game played against an AI.

The program demonstrates the use of random number generation, loops, conditionals, and functions in C++.
